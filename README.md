# Bapstore
The app store for all my mobile projects 

~Only iOS support for now (Sorry!)~ without CORS, I can focus on android support (that's easy) more.

## How to install:
### ~On altstore or sidestore, go to: browse > sources > (Click the plus button) > and type in:~
~https://bush-u.github.io/Bapstore/https://bush-u.github.io/Bapstore/apps.json~ \
This file is still avaliable just in case something does come up. \
If there's a free hosting provider that allows CORS, pls let me know :)

### Altstore doesn't allow stores from sites without CORS and github pages doesn't allow CORS (I think)
-> So instead, I will make the store a website. It's more inconvienient but at least it actually works.

## So, how do you install an app ATM?
#### At the moment, go to https://bush-u.github.io/Bapstore/ and hopefully there's some apps you can get from there
